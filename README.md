Actual gameplay footage
# dom-invaders
A nostalgia piece created using DOM manipulation (instead of Canvas or WebGL) via vanilla JS. All graphics are CSS generated.

## Technologies
This project is purely written in HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS. The only assets used are a font and the images for this README.

I wrote a python script to create the game sprites. It takes as an input a reference image and outputs the corresponding CSS code.
